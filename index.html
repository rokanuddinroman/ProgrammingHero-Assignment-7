        <h2 style="border-left: 5px solid rgb(255, 137, 137); padding-left: 10px;">How Does Javascript Works?</h2>
        <p>One of the most popular language Javascript needs someone to Execute itself. Thats where browser and
            javascript engine comes in the picture. Browsers can't understand the code of Javascipt, that's where
            Javascript
            Engine
            helps converting those Javacsript code into Machine Readable code. Machine Readable code is Bits 0 and 1
            which our computer understands. If we look inside the Javascript Engines, there are two sections called
            MEMORY and CODE. On the other hand being availed to execute one line of code at a time. Javascript is called
            Asynchronous Language.</p>

        <h2 style="border-left: 5px solid rgb(255, 137, 137); padding-left: 10px;">What Does Event Loop Do?</h2>
        <p>Being Javascript is a single threaded language means Javascript only can execute single thread at a run time.
            If we suppose
            there is a restaurant and it has just one waiter for two customers. So the waiter have to serve the first
            customer and then he can take order from second customer. That's what happens in Javascript, Those 2
            customers are Queue. Javascipt needs to do serve first queue at a time time and then it can serve the other.
            So after getting the order and taking them to the cheifs. It won't to be avail to wait to be done cooking.
            It will constantly take orders from customers. In that's way If javascript handling any event and a queue
            get started it need to continue the handling. So Event loop is behind these collecting and processing
            events.</p>

            Session Storage?</h2>
        <p>LocalStorage and SessionStorage Both are Client Side Storage. We can set,get and clear Storage in both Local
            and Session Storage. Primary deference between localStorage and SessionStorage is Data Storing. Data in
            LocalSTorage never get Expired
            untill we close thebrowser but SessionStorage does. LocalSTorage is Accesible from Any Window But
            SessionStorage don't. Both have some pros and cons. You can't use any of them to store any Confidential
            Data.</p>
